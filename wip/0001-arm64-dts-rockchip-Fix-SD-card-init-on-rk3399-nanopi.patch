Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: Fix SD card init on rk3399-nanopi4
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

mmc/SD-card initialization may fail on NanoPi R4S with
"mmc1: problem reading SD Status register" /
"mmc1: error -110 whilst initialising SD card"
either on cold boot or after a reboot.

Moreover, the system would also sometimes hang upon reboot.

This is caused by vcc3v0-sd's "regulator-always-on", which triggers
an erroneous double-initialization of the regulator. This causes
voltage fluctuations that can, depending on timing, prevent the
SD card from initializing correctly.

Adding some liberal delay via "off-on-delay-us" is ineffective since
that codepath is skipped as long "regulator-always-on" is set.

Removing "regulator-always-on" alone is not sufficient because that
would allow the system to set GPIO0_A1 to LOW upon reboot, which may
cause the system to hang.

In order to allow the system to set GPIO0_A1 to HIGH upon initialization
but prevent it from changing it back to LOW, this patch increases the
usage count of vcc3v0-sd from 1 to 2, whereas the additional reference,
"vcc1v8_s3", is marked as "always-on", causing permanent retention.

As a welcome side-effect, this change allows the SD card voltage to be
set back to 3.0V upon reboot, allowing bootloaders to use the card right
away, obsoleting further patching.
