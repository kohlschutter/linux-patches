Subject: [PATCH] regulator: core: Fix off-on-delay-us for always-on/boot-on
 regulators
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Regulators marked with "regulator-always-on" or "regulator-boot-on"
as well as an "off-on-delay-us", may run into cycling issues that are
hard to detect.

This is caused by the "last_off" state not being initialized in this
case.

Fix the "last_off" initialization by setting it to the current kernel
time upon initialization, regardless of always_on/boot_on state.
